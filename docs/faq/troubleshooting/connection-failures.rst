USB connection failures
=======================

uuu exits without displaying anything
-------------------------------------

It seems you're missing the ``libusb-1.0.dll``. Put it right in place with ``uuu.exe``.

Wait for Known USB Device Appear
--------------------------------

If you've already connected the board with your computer, pressing the RESET button might help. Also ensure you have set the bootmode jumper.
